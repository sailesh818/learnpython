  "examples": [
    "class A:\n    def show(self):\n        print('A')\n\nclass B(A):\n    def show(self):\n        print('B')\n\nb = B()\nb.show()  # Output: B",
    "print(len('abc'))  # Output: 3\nprint(len([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3",
    "print(5 + 10)  # Addition for numbers\nprint('Hello ' + 'World')  # Concatenation for strings"

  "summary": "Polymorphism allows Python functions, methods, and operators to take multiple forms depending on context. It enables code flexibility and reuse by allowing different objects to respond to the same function call or operator in their own way."
